# NO LONGER UPDATED GO TO https://github.com/Turbok408/retsodsimc FOR UPDATED VERSION Current Issues:
no int stat in data set \
cant go oom\
no dots\
no procs from items\
flat crit rate for spells\
add temporary stat buffs\
add haste\
assumes you have all buffs + enchants\
assumes target has no armour\
assumes you have wowhead bis talents and runes\
judge is on gcd and doesnt get rid off seal of command (this is probably barely even a dps difference)

# To Use
easiest way to use is just add ids in saves.json in format:\
"format":[
    "head", "neck", "shoulder", "back", "chest", "wrist", "hands", "waist", "legs", "feet", "finger", "finger1", "trinket", "trinket1", "twohand"]\
use id 0 if slot is empty and run sim.py
